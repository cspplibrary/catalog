We’re the first independent, community-run SWANA library on the west coast and possibly the whole so-called US!\nWe’re housed within The SWANA Rose Culture + Community Center, and part of the Center for Study and Preservation of Palestine, started by Ramzy Farouki, a local Palestinian organizer and educator.\nWe’re a resource not to just our own community, but for anyone seeking more education about our homelands and diasporas in this critical time.\nOur collection consists of contemporary and classical SWANA region literature, including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, children’s books, magazines, and zines. We also have a reference collection that houses rare books available for study during our library hours.\nWe’re entirely volunteer-run by a multi-ethnic group of organizers and book lovers. Join us! Check out a book, spread the word, volunteer and build radical community!\n\n\n\nCSPP Library FAQs\n\nWhen is the CSPP library open?\nFirst Wednesday of the month, 6-8 PM\n\n\nWhen can I check out a book?\nDuring open library hours: First Wednesday of the month, 6-8 PM\n\n\nDo I need a library card to check out a book?\nYes!
